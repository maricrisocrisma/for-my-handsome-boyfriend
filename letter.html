      <p> Hiii Love, HAPPY BIRTHDAYYYY!!! 
        I know today didnâ€™t go the way we wanted because of the typhoon, and Iâ€™m really sorry we canâ€™t celebrate together. But even if the weather keeps us apart, nothing can stop me from feeling so grateful for you love.

        Thank you for being you. for making me feel safe, understood, and for loving me in ways i never thought possible. I admire how strong and patient you are to me and how you always carry yourself with kindness. you don't even realize it sometimes, but you inspire me to be better every single day HAHAHAHA, and I honestly feel so lucky to have you in my life. AS IN.
        
        On your special day, I just wish for your happiness, good health, and peace of mind. And i pray that life gives you everything you deserve and more, because you truly are one of the best people I ever know. Youâ€™re so important to me you know that, and I hope you always feel how much I love you, not only today but every single day that weâ€™re together.

You make life lighter, even when things get heavy. you become my safeplace , my comfort zone and my HOME. You make me laugh, you calm me down, and you make me believe that no matter what storms come, weâ€™ll always get through them TOGETHER.
